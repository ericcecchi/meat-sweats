# Project status: Defunct
This project was for the Greater Chicago Food Depository's 2016 Hack Hunger hackathon. We compiled a database of food distribution locations for the various partners in the summer meal program for kids. With a mobile-friendly, lightweight web app, kids could quickly find the nearest meal location to their home or current location and get information such as hours and directions.

The UI for this project is still online, but the backend service no longer exists, so search functionality is broken.
